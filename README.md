The MSCBM Lab is led by **Prof. Hemi Luan**, PhD, and is a part of the School of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences,[GDUT](https://english.gdut.edu.cn/About_Us/About_GDUT.htm), China. We work at the intersection of Mass pectrometry and computational biomedicine.The broad goal of our research is to gain mechanistic insights about human health by using mass spectrometry.

## Things We work with 
Here you can read more about the three main research topics we have at the moment:

####  Mass spectrometry
 - The advent of Mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical technologies has enabled us to survey the whole metabolites, protein, and environmental pollutants from an organism, tissue, cell or biofluid, and decipher molecular mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. The rapid developments in this field have allowed us to generate big data at once, we would like to develop the state-of-the-art MS methods for various analysis tasks and interpreted big data with high quality.

   > Software
  
      - **CPVA 2.0**, is coming soon.
      - **CPVA**, is a free, user-friendly tool to help users to identify peak background noises and contaminants, resulting in decrease of false-positive or redundant peak calling, thereby improving the data quality of non-targeted metabolomics studies. The CPVA used a chromatogram-centric strategy to unfold the characteristics of chromatographic peaks through visualization of peak morphology metrics, with additional functions to annotate adducts, isotopes and contaminants. (Bioinformatics. 2020,36(12):3913-3915). *CPVA was deprecated. Please use CPVA 2.0 instead.*

      - **statTarget**, is a streamlined tool for quality control based signal correction, integration of metabolomics and proteomics data from multi-batch experiments, and the comprehensive statistic analysis (`URL: https://stattarget.github.io`). The statTarget has two basic sections. The first section is  `Signal Correction`. It includes ‘Ensemble Learning’ for QC based signal correction. For example, QC-based random forest correction (QC-RFSC) and QC-based LOESS signal correction (QCRLSC).The second section is `Statistical Analysis`. It provides comprehensively computational and statistical methods that are commonly applied to analyze Omics data, and offers multiple results for biomarker discovery. The  `statTargetGUI` provides the simple easy to use interface for the above functions, which have been online at a stand-alone app [statTargetAPP](https://github.com/statTarget/statTarget2/releases).The package version is at bioconductor with [statTarget](https://bioconductor.org/packages/statTarget/).(Anal Chim Acta. 2018, 1036, 66-72.)![statTarget](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/13479776/Picture/master/shiftC-14.jpg)

####  Computational biomedicine
  - Integrating AI/ML and MS-based data from metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics, we would like to analyze and model complex multidimensional data, such as medical record, environmental exposure, and biological data, etc., to understand the complex biological processes of health and disease.
